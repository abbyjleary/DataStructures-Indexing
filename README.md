# Data Structures Indexing Project

This project was written for my CS3610 Data Structures class in Fall of 2022. The purpose of this project was to use a binary search tree to search for words in a file. 

The only file I modified was index-tree.h and indexing.cc. Other files were provided by Nasseef Abukamail (professor at Ohio University).

Project can be compiled with `make` and run with `./a.out` (this will open a menu to search through words in the `Alan-Turing.txt`  file).
